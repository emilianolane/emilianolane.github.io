				<h4>What is Transcendentalism?</h4>
				<p>
					Transcendentalism is an ideology that formed in the early 19th century that 
					holds several key principles:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Humans are inherently good. However, humans can be corrupted by society, 
						large institutions, etc. Because of this, people are at their best when 
						they are independent.
					</li>
					<li>
						Experience and insight are more important than logic. Transcendentalists
						prioritized creativity and imagination over logic as well.
					</li>
					<li>
						Nature is amazing and beautiful, and it should be respected by humans, 
						especially because we rely on nature to survive. Nature is created to be 
						inherently good, just as humans are.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>History of Transcendentalism</h4>
				<p>
					Transcendentalism emerged in the 19th and originated in the New England region 
					in the United States. Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay "Nature" in 1836 laid the 
					foundation for transcendentalist thought, opposing existing rationalism. 
					The Transcendental Club was created in 1940, and it served as a place for 
					influential Transcendentalists such as Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Margaret Fuller 
					to exchange ideas. Thoreau's book "Walden; or, Life in the Woods" exemplified 
					transcendentalist ideals, advocating for simplicity and a deep connection with 
					nature. While the formal movement waned in the late 19th century, 
					transcendentalism left a lasting impact on American thought and literature, 
					inspiring subsequent generations of writers and thinkers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Transcendentalists actively engaged in social and political reform, 
					particularly during the American Civil War. Many transcendentalists, including 
					Emerson and Thoreau, actively supported the abolitionist movement, advocating 
					for the end of slavery and promoting human rights. Their involvement 
					demonstrated the movement's commitment to social justice and equality. 
					Although the formal transcendentalist movement declined, its emphasis on 
					individualism, self-reliance, and the pursuit of truth resonated with those 
					seeking a deeper connection with themselves and the natural world. 
					Transcendentalist works continue to be influential, shaping American 
					intellectual and cultural history.
